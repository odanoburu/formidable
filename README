#+TITLE: formidable — system F implemented in Haskell

very much a WIP.

following [[https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/][TAPL]] (not strictly though.)

* building

1. download [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][stack]]
2. run
   : stack build --pedantic
   (the first time you run this will probably take some time)


* using
: formidable --help

currently there's a way to evaluate a single file or use a REPL.


* testing

you can run the tests with
: stack test
